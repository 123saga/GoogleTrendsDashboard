## R Shiny Dashboard for Google Trends

Thanks to [gtrendsR](https://github.com/PMassicotte/gtrendsR) it becomes quiet easy to pull [Google Trends data](https://www.google.com/trends/) into R.  

This repository is a shiny dashboard which creates a clickable interface to explore google trends data.

I am happy to see extensions of the dashboard!
